          <p>
            Hi my name is Christopher Munoz. I am a student currently enrolled in a Full Stack Development Bootcamp at UO Eugene Oregon. I have a passion for tech and I am always looking to learn new things. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I am currently looking for a job in the tech industry where I can apply my skills and continue to grow as a developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, playing video games (Destiny, Monster Hunter, Soul-Like, etc.. ), going to the gym, and delving into entertainment with complex/deep lore.
